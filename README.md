This is the final interface for Projects in Programming and Data Science with Prof. Panos Ipeirotis.

Disclaimer: This was my first attempt at Flask + Jinja2, entirely self-taught. I did the entire thing in a YOLO mode over the weekend while writing my thesis at the same time. The quality of this CSS does not reflect the level of my mastery of it. Thank you for understanding :')
